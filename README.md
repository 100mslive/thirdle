A multiplayer wordle game that you can play with your friends while speaking to them over a video call.

Here's a video series on ["How to build Thirdle"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqHX7Ti3L8isxZWw_oE3V4P5n8BPnKQLe) step-by-step.

## What is special?

A video call while playing Wordle canâ€™t be called a multiplayer game right? We wanted to share the playersâ€™ guess words on every new guess they make.

We did it seamlessly without needing a backend (Firebase, etc), but instead using "Peer Metadata" built into the 100ms SDK.

Built with ðŸ’™ using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [100ms SDK](https://www.100ms.live/).  

## Trying it out

Clone the repo and build it with `flutter` commands.

You need 3 things to start playing Thirdle with your own 100ms account (or use the default values if you don't have one)
1. Name - This will be your display name
2. Room Id - Your 100ms room Identifier
3. Subdomain - The subdomain from your 100ms token endpoint

### Room Id
Go to your 100ms Dashboard > Rooms section, copy an existing room's `Room Id` or create a new room and copy its `Room Id`.

### Subdomain
Go to your 100ms Dashboard > Developer section. Find your subdomain in token endpoint.
If your token endpoint is `https://prod-in2.100ms.live/hmsapi/example.app.100ms.live/`, then `example` is your subdomain.
